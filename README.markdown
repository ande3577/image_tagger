# Image Tagger

## Overview

This is a python3-tkinter based utility for tagging users in a set of photos and 
exporting it to a location.  It was a quick one-off script used for creating 
media to distribute to the people inside the photos.  Releasing at as OSS in 
case anyone else finds it useful, or wants to use the code for reference.

Works on windows, not sure about other platforms.

The functionality and stability is somewhat limited and the code is rather ugly.
It probably won't be significantly improved or supported in the future.

## Installation

Requires Python3 and pillow to be installed.

## Usage

Run image_tagger.py with python.
